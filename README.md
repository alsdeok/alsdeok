I am a backend-oriented developer with solid experience in designing, building, and scaling distributed systems. My work has been focused on creating reliable, cloud-native architectures that leverage AWS, Python, Node.js, and frameworks like NestJS to deliver resilient, maintainable services. Iâ€™m motivated by solving complex problems and translating them into clean, efficient solutions that support business growth.

Throughout my career, I have worked implementation of microservices in cloud environments, introducing NestJS as a core framework and contributing to the deployment of dozens of services on AWS. These efforts strengthened the scalability and fault tolerance of the systems I worked on.

Beyond technical delivery, I have collaborated on API integrations, and promoted development guidelines that streamlined processes across teams. I value responsibility and proactive ownership, and I work to encourage a culture of knowledge-sharing, teamwork, and continuous improvement.

Contact me to get a proactive, resolution, adaptive and team worker backend developer.
